# Top K Frequent Words

This project contains a Python solution for the LeetCode-style problem: **Top K Frequent Words**.

## Problem Description
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements. The answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

## Files
- `top_k_frequent_words.py`: Main implementation of the solution.
- `test_top_k_frequent_words.py`: Unit tests for the solution using pytest.

## How to Run the Tests
1. Make sure you have `pytest` installed in your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest test_top_k_frequent_words.py
   ```

```
Input:  words = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
```
